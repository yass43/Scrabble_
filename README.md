# Scrabble Word Finder

This project implements a Scrabble word finder that takes a set of letters and a list of words as input and efficiently finds the largest constructible word using three different data structures: linked list, hash table, and trie.

## Project Description

In this project, we aim to develop a tool for Scrabble enthusiasts to find the largest possible word that can be constructed from a given set of letters. The tool employs three different data structures and algorithms to achieve this goal:

1. **Linked List**: We use a linked list data structure to represent the list of words. The program searches through the linked list to find the largest constructible word from the input set of letters.

2. **Hash Table**: A hash table is utilized to efficiently store and retrieve words from the word list. We employ a hashing algorithm to map words to specific locations in the table and retrieve them quickly.

3. **Trie**: A trie data structure is used to organize and search for words. The program builds a trie from the list of words and traverses it to find the largest constructible word.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Scrabble word finder with the three different methods:

NB : This project was done for a data structure and algorithms class a long time ago.
